# Another Satellite Falls Upon Me

üë®‚ÄçüöÄ üöÄ

A game written in [lua](https://www.lua.org/) using
[L√ñVE](https://love2d.org/wiki/Main_Page) for the GitHub Game Off 2020.

Play as a lone astronaut in this short side-scrolling journey as you
try to recover your equipment and make it back to your ship and crew.

## Origin

This game was built for the [Github Game Off 2020](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2020) where participants were given one month to create a game based on the provided theme. This year's theme was `Moonshot`.

Having created games using Phaser 3 for the GitHub Game Off the past two years ([Ouro](https://github.com/christopherbot/ouro) and [Kernel Space Program](https://github.com/christopherbot/kernel-space-program)), I took the challenge to learn a new programming language for this year's submission.

### Music

The background music is a short original song called "Into Space".
